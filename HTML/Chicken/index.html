<h1>Chicken</h1>
<p>The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated red junglefowl species that are originally from
    Southeast Asia. They have also partially hybridized with other wild species of junglefowls (the grey junglefowl,
    Ceylon junglefowl, and green junglefowl).[1] <b>Rooster</b> and cock are terms for adult male birds, and a younger
    male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen, and
    a sexually immature female is called a pullet. Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both
    their meat and eggs) or as pets. Traditionally they were also bred for cockfighting, which is still practiced in
    some places. Chickens domesticated for meat are broilers and for eggs are layers.</p>

<p>Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as of
    2018,[2] up from more than 19 billion in 2011. There are more chickens in the world than any other bird. There are
    numerous cultural references to chickens—in myth, folklore and religion, and in language and literature.</p>

<h2>Terminology</h2>

<p>An adult male is a called a cock or (in the United States) a rooster and an adult female is called a hen.[9][10]

    Capon: a castrated or neutered male chicken[a]
    Chick: a young chicken[13]
    Chook /tʃʊk/: a chicken (Australia/New Zealand, informal)[14]

<h2>Etymology</h2>
<p>According to Merriam-Webster, the term rooster (i.e. a roosting bird) originated in the mid- or late 18th century as
    a euphemism to avoid the sexual connotation of the original English cock,[22][23][24] and is widely used throughout
    North America. Roosting is the action of perching aloft to sleep at night.[25]</p>

<h2>Behavior</h2>
<h3>Social behaviour</h3>
<p>Chickens are a gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a communal approach to the incubation of eggs
    and raising of young. Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a pecking order, with
    dominant individuals having priority for food access and nesting locations. Removing hens or roosters from a flock
    causes a temporary disruption to this social order until a new pecking order is established. Adding hens, especially
    younger birds, to an existing flock can lead to fighting and injury.[citation needed]</p>

<h3>Vocalizations</h3>
<p>When a rooster finds food, he may call other chickens to eat first. He does this by clucking in a high pitch as well
    as picking up and dropping the food. This behaviour may also be observed in mother hens to call their chicks and
    encourage them to eat.

    A rooster's crowing is a loud and sometimes shrill call and sends a territorial signal to other roosters.[36]
    However, roosters may also crow in response to sudden disturbances within their surroundings.

    Hens cluck loudly after laying an egg and also to call their chicks. Chickens also give different warning calls when
    they sense a predator approaching from the air or on the ground.[37]</p>
